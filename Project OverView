Power BI Project: International Cuisine Restaurant Analysis

Overview
This project is based on a quarter's worth of orders from a fictitious international cuisine restaurant.

Objectives
The project focuses on:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
Visualization and Insights: Developed using Power BI

EDA Process in SSMS
Data was meticulously analyzed in SSMS, querying one table after another. This step-by-step approach facilitated comprehensive EDA, uncovering vital insights about the restaurant's operations:
-Total Items on the Menu
-Most/Least Expensive Item on the Menu
-Total Number of Dishes by Each Category
-Total Orders
-Orders with Total Number of Items
-Top/Least Ordered Items
-Top 5 Orders by Money Spent

Visualization and Insights in Power BI
Power BI was instrumental in visualizing data and deriving actionable insights:
-Average Price by Category
-Number of Dishes by Category
-Total Sales/Orders
-Monthly Sales Trends
-Top/Least Sold Items by Category
-Item-wise Total Orders by Category

DAX Measures
Several DAX measures were created to enhance the analysis, some of them are :
-Total Sales
-Total Orders
-Order Count

Conclusion
This project effectively combines the robust analytical capabilities of SSMS with the powerful visualization tools of Power BI to provide comprehensive insights into the restaurant's performance.
